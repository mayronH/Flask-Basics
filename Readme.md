# Flask Basics 

Some basics examples and  reminders for developing with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/).

## Getting Started

In this project I use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), so after cloning the repo just run the command to install the dependencies for Flask

```
	pipenv install
```
